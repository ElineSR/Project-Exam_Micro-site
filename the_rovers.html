			<b>The first rover</b> on Mars was when the lander Pathfinder touched

		<h1>Sojourner</h1>
		<h3>NASA's First Rover on the Red Planet</h3>
		<p>The lander Pathfinder was launched December 4, 1996 and landed on Mars on July 4,1997.  
		It carried with it the rover Sojourner. Sojourner was named after the American civil rights 
		crusader Sojourner Truth. They worked together with Pathfinder as the base and Sojourner 
		as the explorer. They were meant for demonstrating new technology for landing and for 
		the first-ever robotic rover on the red planet. These goals were met and they performed 
		far beyond expectations. Both outlived their primary purpose and design. Pathfinder with 
		almost three times the expected life length and Sojourner with 12 times.

 		This program of robotic exploration will expand scientists' knowledge of Mars in three 
 		important areas of investigation: the search for evidence of past life on Mars; 
 		understanding the Martian climate and its lessons for the past and future of Earth's 
 		climate; and surveying the geology and resources that could be used to support future 
 		human missions to Mars.
		</p>

				<li>2,3 billion bits of information</li>
				<li>16 500 images from the lander</li>
				<li>550 images from the rover Sojourner</li>
				<li>15 chemical analysis of rocks and soil</li>
				<li>Extensive data on winds and weather</li>
				<li>Together their investigations suggests Mars was at one time warm and wet</li>
				
			</ul>

				<h1>Spirit and Opportunity</h1>
		<h3>The twin rovers</h3>
		<p>Spirit and Opportunity landed on Mars January 3 and January 24, 2004 PST (Jan. 4 and Jan. 25 UTC).
		Both rovers lived well beyond their planned 90-day missions.Spirit lasted 20 times longer than its 
		original design until it concluded its mission in 2010. Opportunity worked nearly 15 years on Mars 
		and broke the driving record for putting the most miles on the odometer. The rover last communicated 
		with Earth on June 10, 2018, as a planet-wide dust storm blanketed the solar-powered rover’s location 
		on Mars.

		First among the mission's scientific goals was to search for and characterize a wide range of 
		rocks and soils for clues to past water activity on Mars. The rovers were targeted to sites on 
		opposite sides of Mars that looked like they were affected by liquid water in the past. 
		Opportunity landed at Meridiani Planum, a possible former lake in a giant impact crater. 
		Spirit landed at Gusev Crater, a place where mineral deposits suggested that Mars had a wet 
		history.

		With data from the rovers, mission scientists have reconstructed an ancient past when Mars 
		was awash in water. Spirit and Opportunity each found evidence for past wet conditions that 
		possibly could have supported microbial life.
		</p>
		
		<h2>All the Right Moves</h2>
		<p>Each rover was created to be the mechanical equivalent of a geologist walking from place to place. 
		The mast-mounted cameras are 5 feet (1.5 meters) high and provide 360-degree two-eyed, humanlike 
		views of the terrain. The robotic arm moves like a human arm with an elbow and wrist, and can place 
		instruments directly up against rock and soil targets of interest. The mechanical "hand" of the arm 
		holds a microscopic camera that serves the same purpose as a geologist's handheld magnifying lens. 
		The Rock Abrasion Tool is like a geologist's rock hammer that exposes the insides of rocks.</p>
			<h3>Top Science findings Spirit and Discovery:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Salty water</li>
				<li>Warmer climate</li>
				<li>Watery past</li>
				<li>Ancient volcano</li>
				<li>Past flowing water</li>
				<li>Right conditions for life</li>
				
			</ul>
				<h2>Opportunity's Mission Is Complete</h2>
			<p>No response has been received from Opportunity since Sol 5111 (June 10, 2018), amid a 
			planet-encircling dust storm on Mars. With the last uplink transmission on Sol 5352 
			(Feb. 12, 2019), the rover recovery efforts are concluded. The Opportunity mission 
			is complete. </p>
			
				<h2>Spirit Remains Silent at Troy</h2>
			<p>More than 1,300 commands were radiated to Spirit as part of the recovery effort in an 
			attempt to elicit a response from the rover. No communication has been received from Spirit 
			since Sol 2210 (March 22, 2010). The project concluded the Spirit recovery efforts on May 25, 
			2011. The remaining, pre-sequenced ultra-high frequency (UHF) relay passes scheduled for 
			Spirit on board the Odyssey orbiter will complete on June 8, 2011. </p>

			<h1>Curiosity</h1>
		<h3>The current Rover</h3>
		<p>Part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, Curiosity is the largest and most capable rover ever sent to Mars to date. 
		It launched November 26, 2011 and landed on Mars at 10:32 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5, 2012 (1:32 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6, 2012).
		Curiosity set out to answer the question: Did Mars ever have the right environmental conditions to support small life 
		forms called microbes? Early in its mission, Curiosity's scientific tools found chemical and mineral evidence of
		past habitable environments on Mars. It continues to explore the rock record from a time when Mars 
		could have been home to microbial life.

		Curiosity explores and acquires rock, soil, and air samples for onboard analysis. The car-size rover is 
		about as tall as a basketball player and uses a 7 foot-long arm to place tools close to rocks selected 
		for study. It hunts for special rocks that formed in water and/or have signs of organics.

		Curiosity carries the biggest, most advanced instruments for scientific studies ever sent to 
		the Martian surface. The history of Martian climate and geology is written in the chemistry 
		and structure of the rocks and soil. Curiosity reads this record by analyzing powdered samples 
		drilled from rocks. It also measures the chemical fingerprints present in different rocks and 
		soils to determine their composition and history, especially their past interactions with water.
		</p>
